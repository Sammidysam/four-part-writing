#1: I think this could be a good edge case of the
partwriting being complete
#4: took third chord to be I6, but not sure
if that is right
#5: ignored suspension beat entirely
#7: this is incomplete because Neapolitan diminished 7
was a bit unknown to me given the D being in the alto
I figure this is something directly taught in class
#8: should the second chord be a 7?

Pg. 1, I, #1: we do not handle suspensions, so chord 3 was simplified to V7
Pg. 1, I, #2: not sure what the handwritten switch in chord is supposed to mean,
so figured I would make two examples out of it
For #2b with a fully diminished 7 chord, I also changed the second to last
soprano note to G natural
Pg. 1, I, #3: because we do not handle suspensions, I left out beat 3 of the
first full measure entirely
Pg. 1, I, #5: splitting handwritten chord into two examples.
leaving out the suspension beat entirely
Pg. 1, I, #6: splitting handwritten chord into two examples.
leaving out suspension beat entirely

Pg. 1, II, #4: left out entire suspension beat

Pg. 2, #1: simplified the eighth notes into only the 7th
being in the bass
took out the suspension beat entirely and did not try
to have 8th notes
Pg. 2, #2: took out the suspension beat entirely and did not try
to have 8th notes

Pg. 3 is not relevant to this program, so skipped

Pg. 4, #1: left out suspension beat entirely
left out 8th notes in bass
Pg. 4, #2: I do not know what P64 F# would define here,
so I skipped this rather than think about it too much
Pg. 4, #3: figuring this might have a validation error,
as I think the suspension calls for omitting the fifth.
left out the suspension beat entirely
Pg. 4, #4: left out suspension beat entirely

Pg. 12: do

Pg. 13: do

Pg. 15: do, but I need to review common tone diminished 7ths
and also see if augmented sixths work within our program fine

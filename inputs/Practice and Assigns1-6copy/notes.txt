Pg. 1, #1: we do not handle suspensions, so chord 3 was simplified to V7
Pg. 1, #2: not sure what the handwritten switch in chord is supposed to mean,
so figured I would make two examples out of it
For #2b with a fully diminished 7 chord, I also changed the second to last
soprano note to G natural
Pg. 1, #3: because we do not handle suspensions, I left out beat 3 of the
first full measure entirely
We also need a diminished without seventh chord symbol

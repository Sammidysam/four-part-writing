Pg. 1, I, #1: we do not handle suspensions, so chord 3 was simplified to V7
Pg. 1, I, #2: not sure what the handwritten switch in chord is supposed to mean,
so figured I would make two examples out of it
For #2b with a fully diminished 7 chord, I also changed the second to last
soprano note to G natural
Pg. 1, I, #3: because we do not handle suspensions, I left out beat 3 of the
first full measure entirely
We also need a diminished without seventh chord symbol - that is left as ? for now
Pg. 1, I, #4: need a diminished without seventh chord symbol - left as ?
Pg. 1, I, #5: splitting handwritten chord into two examples.

to have 8th notes

Pg. 4, #1: need diminished without seventh chord symbol
left out suspension beat entirely
left out 8th notes in bass
Pg. 4, #2: I do not know what P64 F# would define here,
so I skipped this rather than think about it too much
Pg. 4, #3: figuring this might have a validation error,
as I think the suspension calls for omitting the fifth.

need diminished without seventh chord symbol
Pg. 4, #4: left out suspension beat entirely
